This archive contains the distribution Types-DBIx-Class,
version 1.000000:

  Types::Tiny for DBIx::Class objects

It provides type checking for various DBIx::Class objects "Schema",
"Rows", "ResultSet", and "ResultSource", and allows parameterizing
those types where it makes sense to do so. It can be used standalone,
or with Moo, Mouse, or Moose for "isa" attribute type checking.

It is pure perl, and depends on only Type::Tiny (which is part of
Moo, but does not require Moo), Sub::Quote, and DBIx::Class.

The "authoring build" uses Module::Build::Tiny and "mbtiny". The
author writes the dependencies in "cpanfile", and metadata in
"metamerge.yml". Then "mbtiny dist" generates the MANIFEST, Build.PL,
META.json, and META.yml files and builds the tarball.
